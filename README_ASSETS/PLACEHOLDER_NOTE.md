# README Assets Folder

This folder is designated for storing images and visual assets used in the project's README file.

## Purpose
- Store screenshots of the portfolio
- Store demo images and GIFs
- Store project preview images
- Store any other visual documentation assets

## Note
Since this is a code-only environment, placeholder files are created instead of actual images.
In a real implementation, you would add your actual project screenshots and demo images here.

## Recommended Assets
- `portfolio-screenshot.png` - Main portfolio landing page
- `portfolio-mobile.png` - Mobile responsive view
- `project-demo.gif` - Interactive demo of key features
- `tech-stack.png` - Visual representation of technologies used

Remember to optimize images for web use and maintain consistent naming conventions.
